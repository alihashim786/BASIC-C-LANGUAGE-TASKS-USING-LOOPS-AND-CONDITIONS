# BASIC-C-LANGUAGE-TASKS-USING-LOOPS-AND-CONDITIONS
This repository contains some logical building c++ tasks that will be you understand the syntax and logic and improve your coding skills on c++

## Question 1:  
**Marks**: 20

You will design the architecture below:

Each Circle represents a variable that will be flagged as `true` or `false`. You need to:
1. Ask the user to flag which variable is `true`, and others will be marked `false`.
2. Convert the variable index `0-9` into its binary and mark the layer 2 variables with the binary number. Layer 2 will have 4 Circles, meaning four variables.
   
   For example, if 9 is marked, its binary is `1001`, so layer 2 variables 1 and 4 will be marked as `1` (true), and variables 2 and 3 will be marked as `0` (false).
3. Use the switches to implement which variables in Layer 2 are `True` and `False` to mark Layer 3's only variable with the value of the index variable that was turned on.

## Question 2:  
**Marks**: 20

You have to implement the following pattern using **for loops** and **if-else statements**. You cannot hardcode the pattern.

- Ask the user for a **scale factor** to scale the pattern.
- Values from 1 to 2 can be used:
  - 1 produces the same pattern.
  - 1.5 produces a 50% larger pattern.
  - 2 produces double the pattern size.

Your code should handle all input checks and ensure the pattern is generated generically.

## Question 3:  
**Marks**: 20

Develop a restaurant menu of your choice. The menu must have at least **20 items**. The user can order a maximum of **6 items** from the menu.

1. Ask for the user's name and contact number.
2. Ask for the items the user wants to purchase and whether they want more items.
3. Ask for the **quantity** of each item.
4. At the end, generate a **bill** showing:
   - Item name, quantity, and total cost.
   - Add **GST (12%)** to the total.

**Bill Example**:

### Submission Instructions:
- Submit a zip file following the naming convention: `i22xxxx_Assignment_3_DS/AI_X`.
- Each question should have the naming convention `i22xxxx_q1.cpp`.
- Submit only `.cpp` files in a zip. Failing to do so will result in a **30%** marks reduction.
- **Plagiarism is strongly discouraged**. If plagiarism is detected, you will receive **0 marks** for this assignment, and there will be a **50% reduction** in marks for a previous assignment.
- **Commenting**, proper naming conventions, and indentation carry marks. Be sure to follow these guidelines.

## Question 4:  
**Marks**: 10

Write a C++ program to convert a **decimal number** to its **hexadecimal** and **octal** equivalents.  
- You are only allowed to use **ternary operators** (no if-else or switch statements).
  
**Example**:
Decimal = 20
Hexadecimal = 14
Octal = 24

## Question 5:  
**Marks**: 10

Write a C++ program that:
- Takes a **sentence** as input and finds all possible **subwords** (either in reverse or normal order).
- It should also count the **number of words**, **special characters**, and **characters** in the sentence.

**Example**:

Sentence: This is a good assignment everyone can do this good assignment siht.
Subword: This
Number of times subword found: 3
Number of words: 12
Number of characters: 68
Number of special characters: 1

## Question 6:  
**Marks**: 10

Write code to generate the following pattern, allowing the user to input the **largest number** and the **number of diamonds**:

**Example**:
Number of Diamonds: 2
Largest number: 5

    11         11<br>  
   2112       2112<br>
  321123     321123<br>
